# Intro to React

# I want it raw!

To create a new app, instead of using this skeleton, you can either checkout the first commit in this repo and follow the getting started instructions, or run `npm install -g create-react-app` and then `create-react-app [your-name-here]` to generate a new folder, `/[your-name-here]`, with a basic app in it.

# Getting started

Having cloned this repo and checked out the commit/tag you want to use as your base you can run `yarn install` to install all the required packages and then `yarn start` to start the dev server on http://localhost:3000. The dev server watches all your files and will reload whenever you change your code.

# More to come

We will add more info as we go along, in the meantime you get to play on your own :)
